		<h2>Welcome All</h2>
		<p>I am Scott.Js(Scott Terry). I am a Software Engineer, Model and Actor for Sk Model Management in Rock Island, Il. I've been programming now for 3 years going on 4. I currently work for Xymmetrix LLC in Fort Wayne, Indiana. All tech field related interest include everything imaginable. The highlights right now are Web Apps, Mobile Apps and Robotics. Outside of tech you can find me obssessed with anime, doing magic on my skateboard, filling the air with music notes on my guitar, sending golf balls into space, debating with random people on Facebook or chilling out to Family Guy. Competing in 4k's and trying to break ankles on the court is something I do to keep myself in shape considering sitting on a computer and typing isn't technically exercise. I love teaching the masses information about the latest tech. It also helps me stay up to date and current on whats coming out. As a teacher and proud nerd/weirdo/geek I bid whoever is reading this long life, health and a sincere welcome to my site. Enjoy.   </p>
